**Summary: Software-Sorted Geographies (2005)**

**Introduction: Code and the Remediation of Inequality**
The modern city is heavily influenced by computer software, which permeates and shapes various aspects of contemporary societies. Despite its significant role, the attention given to the millions of lines of code running cities has been limited. This paper explores the automatic production of space through the continuous agency of computer software in shaping social and geographical inequalities.

**One Person's Infrastructure is Another's Difficulty: Software-Sorting and Political Economies of 'Unbundling'**
The term 'software-sorting' is introduced to describe how code mediates social worlds by automatically and continuously allocating access to goods, services, life chances, and mobility opportunities. This process plays a critical role in selectively granting access based on consumerist criteria, creating a landscape of power where certain groups are prioritized while others are marginalized.

**Code Space: Software-Sorted Mobilities**
Physical mobility systems, such as airports and highways, use powerful software-sorting techniques to manage flows and control access. The paper discusses how software-sorting influences the dynamics of mobility, pricing strategies, and the creation of differential geographies of mobility.

**Software-Sorted Geographies**
The Internet, mobile phones, and other electronic systems undergo mass customization and unbundling through software-sorting techniques. This influences advertising, communication, and service delivery, allowing targeted customization based on individual habits, preferences, and geographic locations.

**Code Place: Software-Sorted Cities**
Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Geodemographic Information Systems (GDIS) play a crucial role in shaping urban spaces. These systems surveil social geographies, reinforcing spatial and social classifications, and contributing to the consumerization of urban spaces.

**Code Face: Software-Sorted Streets**
Facial recognition CCTV systems use algorithms to identify and track individuals, raising concerns about privacy and biases. The paper discusses how these systems may deepen existing inequalities and reshape interactions within urban spaces.

**Conclusions: Towards a Spatial Politics of Code**
The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for a critical approach to software-sorting techniques. While acknowledging their impact on social and public realms, the authors highlight the importance of resisting and dismantling inequitable systems.
