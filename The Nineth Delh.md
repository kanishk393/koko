**Summary:**
The lecture, delivered by Patwant Singh, commemorates Sir George Birdwood and focuses on the architectural history of Delhi, particularly the Ninth Delhi or the present Delhi of independent India. Patwant Singh, born in Delhi, comes from a family involved in construction and engineering. He highlights the historical significance of Delhi, which has witnessed the rise and fall of several legendary cities.

**Historical Overview of Delhis:**

1. **Indraprastha (First Delhi):** Built in the Vedic period, around the tenth century BC, according to the Mahabharata. Excavations at Purana Qila reveal insights into this ancient city.

2. **Lai Kot (Second Delhi):** Established in the eleventh century by King Anang Pal of the Tomara dynasty. The Iron Pillar, now near Qutb Minar, is a symbol from this era.

3. **Siri (Third Delhi):** Founded in 1303 by Ala-ud-din Khilji, who also completed the Qutb Minar. Hauz Khas, another architectural complex, is attributed to Ala-ud-din.

4. **Tughlaqabad (Fourth Delhi):** Built by Ghiyas-ud-din Tughlaq in the fourteenth century. Mohammed Tughlaq later shifted the capital to Jahanpanah.

5. **Firozabad (Fifth Delhi):** Established by Firuz Tughlaq, while the capital remained at Jahanpanah. Flourished as a cultural center.

6. **Dinpanah (Sixth Delhi or Purana Qila):** Constructed by Humayun, the Mughal Emperor, in the sixteenth century. The period also marked the sack of Delhi by Timur.

7. **Seventh Delhi:** Sher Shah, a ruler between the Mughals, expanded Purana Qila and ruled Delhi for a brief period.

8. **Eighth Delhi:** The British Delhi, criticized for isolation from the nation at large, saw a shift in fate after 1947.

**Analysis and Perspectives:**

- Patwant Singh disagrees with the assessment that New Delhi, as planned by Lutyens and Baker, faced a fate similar to the Eighth Delhi. He emphasizes the impact of 1947 on reshaping Delhi's destiny.
- Asok Mitra's parallel between Antaeus and Heracles and Delhi's fate is discussed, highlighting the importance of Delhi's connection with Indian reality.

The lecture aims to provide a historical perspective on Delhi's evolution, tracing its journey through various periods and rulers.

**Summary:**

**1. Introduction to Shahjahanabad:**
Delhi underwent a period of decline until Shahjahan, the Mughal emperor, built Shahjahanabad in 1648, the seventh Delhi. Shahjahan's architectural contributions, such as the Red Fort and Jama Masjid, were on a grand scale. Shahjahanabad remains a prominent area in present-day Delhi, housing Chandni Chowk and other historical sites.

**2. Shahjahan's Architectural Influence:**
Shahjahan introduced a new architectural scale and sensuous style to Delhi, using marble extensively. His reign marked the zenith of Mughal power and Delhi's prominence in Asia.

**3. British Arrival and Capital Shift:**
The British arrived in Delhi in 1803 and later decided to shift the capital from Calcutta to Delhi in 1911, citing historical and political reasons. This led to the establishment of New Delhi.

**4. Development of New Delhi:**
New Delhi, the eighth Delhi, was planned by architects Lutyens and Baker. The city was designed to be imperial, symbolizing British power. It was developed along a hexagonal pattern, covering 3,200 acres with a projected population of 65,000.

**5. Post-Independence Challenges:**
After India gained independence, Delhi faced an influx of refugees, leading to unplanned suburban growth. The Master Plan of 1962 aimed to guide development, but the explosive nature of post-independence challenges hindered comprehensive planning.

**6. Current Issues in Urban Development:**
Current challenges include the misguided implementation of high-rise buildings, encroachment on green areas, and fragmented control among municipal authorities. The lack of political interest in architecture and urban planning exacerbates these issues.

**7. Concerns for Future Development:**
The future of Delhi's development raises concerns about maintaining architectural quality, preventing land speculation, and addressing the impact of high-rise structures. The author emphasizes the need for thoughtful urban planning to preserve Delhi's unique character.

**8. Conclusion:**
Delhi, now the Ninth Delhi, is a dynamic city attempting to consolidate its diverse history. The author highlights the importance of overcoming current challenges to ensure the city's sustainable and culturally rich future.

The speaker highlights several concerns about the development of Delhi and suggests possible solutions. Here's a summarized version:
