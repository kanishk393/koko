The passage you've provided discusses the concepts of "power" as understood by Max Weber and Hannah Arendt, with some references to Talcott Parsons. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Max Weber's Concept of Power (Macht)**:
   - Max Weber defines "power" (Macht) as the ability to force one's will on the behavior of others.
   - Weber uses a teleological model of action, where individuals or groups choose means to achieve specific goals. Success is achieving the desired state.
   - If success depends on another's behavior, the actor must have the means to influence that behavior, which Weber calls "power."

2. **Hannah Arendt's Concept of Power**:
   - Hannah Arendt sees "power" as the ability to agree upon a common course of action through unconstrained communication.
   - Power is not an individual property but belongs to a group and exists as long as the group remains together.
   - When someone is "in power," it means they are empowered by a group to act on their behalf.
   - Power, in Arendt's view, is about forming a common will through communication.

3. **Comparison and Contrast**:
   - Weber's concept of power is based on instrumental means to achieve individual or group goals. It can involve coercion or manipulation.
   - Arendt's concept emphasizes the formation of a common will through communication and consensus.
   - Arendt's view of power is rooted in the belief that seriously intended agreement is an end in itself and cannot be instrumentalized for other purposes.
   - Both Weber and Arendt recognize the role of social relationships in the exercise of power, but they differ in their fundamental approach.

4. **Talcott Parsons' View on Power**:
   - Talcott Parsons understands power as the capacity of a social system to achieve collective goals through mobilizing consent.
   - He aligns power with the teleological concept of goal attainment, similar to Weber's perspective.
   - Parsons emphasizes the importance of legitimization and resource mobilization in understanding power within a social system.

5. **The Role of Rational Validity in Arendt's View**:
   - Arendt highlights that consensus formed through unconstrained communication is not merely about achieving success but about rational validity claims inherent in speech.
   - Even if convictions can be manipulated, the rationality claims upon which they are based must be considered.

In summary, Max Weber, Hannah Arendt, and Talcott Parsons offer different perspectives on the concept of power. Weber focuses on instrumental means to achieve goals, while Arendt emphasizes the role of unconstrained communication in forming a common will. Parsons bridges these views by considering power within social systems and its connection to resource mobilization and legitimization. Arendt's emphasis on rational validity claims in communication distinguishes her perspective from Weber's focus on success-oriented actions.


This passage delves deeper into Hannah Arendt's concept of power as it relates to communicative action and intersubjectivity. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **The Nature of Communicatively Produced Power**:
   - Power, as understood by Hannah Arendt, originates from the fact that individuals or groups involved in communication are primarily oriented toward reaching agreement, rather than individual success.
   - Communication in this context is not used merely to force others into desired behavior (perlocutionarily) but to establish noncoercive intersubjective relationships (illocutionarily).
   - Arendt's concept of power is disconnected from the teleological model of action, emphasizing collective effects of speech where agreement is an end in itself.

2. **The Normative Content of Communicatively Produced Power**:
   - Arendt's concept of power has normative implications. It serves to maintain the praxis (human activities) that it originates from.
   - Power becomes consolidated and embodied in political institutions that secure forms of life centered on reciprocal speech.
   - Power manifests itself in orders protecting liberty, resistance against threats to political liberty, and revolutionary actions establishing new institutions of liberty.
   - Public support is crucial for the legitimacy and continuation of these institutions.

3. **The Structure of Unimpaired Intersubjectivity**:
   - Arendt's practical philosophy, as presented in "The Human Condition," focuses on the formal properties of communicative action (praxis) and its role in cultural life.
   - Communicative action generates an intersubjective life-world in which actors appear, encounter each other, and engage in shared experiences.
   - The life-world is characterized by human plurality (multiple perspectives), natality (new beginnings), and securing individual and group identities.
   - Praxis and communication are central to this life-world, and their protection is essential for human existence.

4. **The Role of Political Institutions**:
   - Political institutions in organized societies protect the vulnerable structures of intersubjectivity and praxis.
   - Power is drawn from unimpaired intersubjectivity and must protect these structures from deformations.
   - Arendt emphasizes that no political leadership can replace power with force and that legitimate power requires a nondeformed public realm.

5. **The Actuality of Power**:
   - Power cannot be stored for emergencies; it exists only in actualization.
   - It is realized where words and deeds are in harmony, where words establish relations and create new realities.
   - Power sustains the public realm, which is the potential space of appearance for acting and speaking individuals.

In summary, this passage outlines how Hannah Arendt's concept of power is rooted in communicative action and unimpaired intersubjectivity. It emphasizes the normative aspect of power in maintaining the public realm and protecting structures of communication and praxis. Power, in this context, is not a static entity but exists only in its active realization through meaningful words and deeds.


This section discusses some of the applications of Hannah Arendt's communications concept of power in understanding political dynamics, particularly in the context of totalitarian rule and revolutionary movements:

**(a) Totalitarian Rule and the Danger of Privatism:**
- Arendt's investigations focus on the destruction of political liberty under totalitarian regimes, such as Nazism and Stalinism.
- Totalitarian rule isolates citizens from one another through mistrust and suppresses public exchange of opinions.
- Fear and terror force individuals to become isolated from one another, resulting in depoliticization and a loss of initiative.
- Totalitarian rule mobilizes depoliticized masses, making individuals accomplices in actions and crimes of the regime.
- Arendt criticizes the privatism inherent in modern societies and the dangers of mediatizing the population, which can lead to totalitarian rule.

**(b) Emancipatory Movements and the Power of Common Conviction:**
- Arendt examines emancipatory movements, including bourgeois revolutions, uprisings, civil disobedience, and student protests.
- She is interested in the power of common conviction and the withdrawal of obedience to illegitimate institutions.
- Emancipatory movements involve confronting communicative power with the coercive means of an impotent state apparatus.
- They represent a new beginning in politics and an attempt to institutionalize the communicative generation of power.
- Arendt's concept of power is highlighted as something that arises between individuals when they act together and vanishes when they disperse.

**(c) Institutionalizing Direct Democracy:**
- Arendt identifies attempts to institutionalize direct democracy in various historical contexts, such as American town meetings, Parisian populaires, the Paris Commune, Russian Soviets, and German Rdtedemokratie.
- These attempts represent serious efforts to establish a constitution of liberty in mass society.
- She attributes the failure of these attempts to the political defeats of revolutionary labor movements and the economic success of labor unions and parties, which led to workers becoming jobholders within society.

In summary, this section demonstrates how Hannah Arendt's communications concept of power is applied to analyze the dynamics of totalitarian rule, the power of common conviction in emancipatory movements, and the challenges of institutionalizing direct democracy in modern mass societies. Arendt's emphasis on the role of communication and collective action in the exercise of power is central to her analysis of these political phenomena.


In this section, the author discusses some limitations and weaknesses of Hannah Arendt's communications concept of power:

**(a) Exclusion of Strategic Elements:**
- Arendt's concept of power focuses on communicative action, excluding strategic elements such as the use of force from politics.
- By doing so, she neglects the role of coercion and violence in political processes.
- This exclusion limits her ability to analyze power dynamics in situations where force plays a significant role.

**(b) Separation of Politics from Economic and Social Context:**
- Arendt's conceptual dichotomies, such as public vs. private and state vs. economy, lead to a separation of politics from its economic and social environment.
- She criticizes the intrusion of social and economic matters into the public realm and views administrative processing of social problems as detrimental to politics.
- This perspective may not be applicable to modern societies where the boundaries between politics, economics, and society are more fluid.

**(c) Inability to Grasp Structural Violence:**
- Arendt's concept of power does not adequately address the concept of structural violence.
- Structural violence refers to forms of violence that are built into social, economic, or political systems and can result in harm and inequality without the need for direct physical force.
- Arendt's focus on communicative action may limit her ability to analyze and address structural forms of oppression and violence.

The author suggests that to make Arendt's concept of power more effective, it should be freed from the constraints of an Aristotelian theory of action. This would allow for a broader and more nuanced analysis of power dynamics in modern societies, including the consideration of strategic elements, the interconnectedness of politics, economics, and society, and the recognition of structural violence.


In this section, the author discusses the relationship between the production and employment of legitimate power in the political system, drawing on the perspectives of both Hannah Arendt and Talcott Parsons:

1. **Production of Power:**
   - Arendt emphasizes that legitimate power arises from unconstrained communication and common convictions among individuals.
   - She believes that power cannot be generated "from above" through manipulation or persuasion but must originate in the structures of open and free communication.

2. **Parsons' Systems Perspective:**
   - Parsons approaches power from a systems perspective, where the production of power is seen as a problem to be solved by influencing the will of the population.
   - According to Parsons, there are no structural limits to the production of power within a given cultural context.

3. **Differentiation between Serious and Unserious Power Credits:**
   - Parsons acknowledges the need to differentiate between responsible political leadership, which commits the collectivity to fulfill obligations beyond its capacity, and reckless overextendedness.
   - He draws an analogy with responsible banking and "wildcatting" in financial terms.

4. **Arendt's Solution:**
   - Arendt attempts to address this problem by deriving the conditions for communicatively engendered or expanded power from the structures of unimpaired intersubjectivity.
   - She believes that a legitimate exercise of power requires the existence of a public-political realm where common convictions can be formed and commitments made.

The author suggests that Arendt's approach offers a solution to the challenge of differentiating between responsible and reckless power credits by emphasizing the importance of unconstrained communication and common convictions in the production and exercise of legitimate power. This perspective provides a basis for understanding the conditions under which power can be responsibly employed within a political system.


In this section, the author discusses two points of criticism related to the concept of power and politics, drawing from the perspectives of both Hannah Arendt and Talcott Parsons:

1. **Extending the Concept of the Political:**
   - The author argues that the concept of the political should encompass both the strategic competition for political power and the employment of power within the political system.
   - Politics, in this view, cannot be solely identified with the praxis of individuals engaging in unconstrained communication and common action.

2. **Distinguishing Power from Force:**
   - The author points out the distinction between power and force. While power is a good that political groups struggle for and manage, it is not something they produce themselves.
   - According to this perspective, political leaders and groups must obtain their power from those who produce it through common convictions and unconstrained communication.

3. **Structural Violence and Ideologies:**
   - The author proposes that structural violence, which operates inconspicuously and blocks unconstrained communication, can explain the formation of ideologies.
   - Ideologies, in this context, are seen as illusions outfitted with the power of common convictions, generated within restricted communications.

4. **Arendt's View on Knowledge and Opinion:**
   - The author highlights a difference in Arendt's approach to knowledge and opinion. Arendt holds that opinions formed in practical matters cannot be true or false but are products of discursive thinking.
   - Arendt seeks to anchor the power of common convictions in the capability of responsible subjects to make and keep promises, placing her trust in the contract theory of natural law.

The author raises questions about whether structural violence and ideology can account for the generation of power through common convictions and whether it is possible to distinguish between illusionary and non illusionary convictions. The discussion also underscores the contrast between Arendt's view on knowledge and opinion and the notion of representative thought.
