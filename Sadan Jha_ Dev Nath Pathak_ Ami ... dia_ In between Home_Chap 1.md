The book "Neighbourhoods in Urban India" by Sadan Jha, Dev Nath Pathak, and Amiya Kumar Das explores the significance of neighborhoods in the context of South Asian cities, particularly in India. The authors argue that neighborhoods play a vital role in shaping urban life and experiences but have often been overlooked in social sciences. This book aims to rectify this oversight by delving into the subjectivities and experiences of neighborhoods in India.

**Introduction:**

The introductory chapter sets the stage for the book's exploration of neighborhoods in urban India. It highlights the unique role neighborhoods play in the lives of urban dwellers and their significance in connecting the individual home with the broader city. The authors emphasize that neighborhoods are not just physical spaces but have their own agency, subjectivity, and historical context.

**Urbanization in South Asia:**

The authors discuss the urbanization trend in South Asia, with a focus on India. They note that a significant percentage of the population lives in urban areas, making cities the epicenter of dreams, aspirations, and social realities. They draw upon the work of Louis Wirth to highlight the multifaceted nature of urbanism and its impact on social life.

**The Neglected Element: Neighborhoods:**

Despite the increasing attention on cities in academic and policy discourse, neighborhoods have often been overlooked. The book argues that neighborhoods are a fundamental building block of urban life and deserve a more in-depth exploration. It notes that previous scholarship has primarily focused on the physical aspects of neighborhoods or their cultural dimensions, ignoring their social and institutional aspects.

**The Unique Role of Neighborhoods:**

The authors position neighborhoods as an intermediary space between the home and the city. They emphasize that neighborhoods are not merely transitional zones but have their own complexities, practices, and histories. Without neighborhoods, one cannot truly understand urban life in India.

**Multidisciplinary Framework:**

To address this gap in understanding, the book adopts a multidisciplinary framework. It seeks to explore neighborhoods as both physical spaces and social institutions, emphasizing their historical and spatial specificities.

**Spatial Subjectivities:**

The book aims to unravel the concept of "spatial subjectivities" by examining four core aspects: value regimes, inequalities and exclusion based on caste and community, gendered spatial relationships, and the politics of planning and housing. These dimensions provide insights into the intricate web of neighborhood subjectivities.

**Conclusion:**

In summary, "Neighbourhoods in Urban India" introduces the concept of neighborhoods as a crucial but neglected element in the study of urban life in India. It highlights the unique role of neighborhoods in connecting homes with cities and argues for a multidisciplinary exploration of their spatial and social dimensions. The book's chapters delve deeper into these themes, offering a comprehensive understanding of neighborhood subjectivities and experiences in India's urban landscape.


The excerpt discusses the historical evolution and various definitions of the term "neighborhood" in the context of American cities, highlighting its dynamic nature. It also touches on how different scholars and eras have shaped the understanding of neighborhoods:

1. **Historical Dynamics of Neighborhoods:** The passage emphasizes that the concept of neighborhoods has evolved over time and is not static. It begins by suggesting that in American cities, neighborhoods as identifiable units emerged as a response to the transition from pedestrian cities of the 18th and 19th centuries to more complex and differentiated urban structures in the early 20th century.

2. **Early Differentiation:** While there's a common belief that 18th and 19th-century American cities were characterized by mixed land uses, the passage points out that even during this period, residential neighborhoods were differentiated based on wealth and occupational status. The description of concentric zones and the socio-economic distribution of residents in these zones is provided.

3. **Complementarity and Community-Centric Logic:** The passage mentions the shift from the idea of neighborhoods as complementary units forming a larger metropolis to a community-centric logic. Scholars in the early 20th century, such as Robert A. Woods and Wilbur C. Phillips, explored the concept of neighborhoods as discrete entities with their own expressions within the larger city.

4. **The 'Neighborhood Revolution':** In the 1960s, there was a significant shift with the emergence of the 'neighborhood revolution,' where various neighborhoods began advocating for their own forms of revitalization. This led to the formation of grassroots organizations and community involvement in urban issues.

5. **Geographical and Social Aspects:** The passage also discusses how neighborhoods can be defined in terms of geographical boundaries and housing homogeneity, which often align with social class. However, it acknowledges that geographical and social elements do not always align, and definitions of neighborhoods can vary among observers.

6. **Utopian Vision:** Various definitions and approaches to neighborhoods are explored, with a recurring theme being the utopian vision of neighborhoods as smaller units retaining essential human characteristics in contrast to the alienation and violence often associated with larger metropolitan areas.

7. **Jane Jacobs' Perspective:** The passage concludes by referencing Jane Jacobs' perspective, emphasizing that a successful neighborhood is one that can address its problems and not be overwhelmed by them.

Overall, this excerpt provides historical context and multiple perspectives on the concept of neighborhoods in American cities, highlighting the evolving nature of this fundamental aspect of urban life.

This passage discusses the evolving discourse on neighborhoods, particularly in the context of urban planning, urban sociology, and urban studies. It highlights several key themes and shifts in the understanding of neighborhoods:

1. **Persistence of the Hope in Neighborhoods:** Despite critiques of dominant urban planning practices, the belief in the potential of neighborhoods to foster social bonding, neighborliness, and create harmonious cities continues to exist. This idea of neighborhoods as places of community and social cohesion persists.

2. **The Influence of Jane Jacobs:** Jane Jacobs' concept of turning streets into units for understanding neighborhoods, as opposed to larger planning units, opened up new possibilities for scholars, particularly anthropologists. However, the full potential of this perspective, especially in the Global South, is yet to be fully explored.

3. **Inequality and Spatial Dynamics:** The passage acknowledges that neighborhoods are not homogenous, and issues of inequality related to ethnicity, public health, crime, and informality can significantly impact the dynamics within neighborhoods. It highlights that working-class or immigrant settlements have often been stigmatized as "problem areas."

4. **Shift from Euro-American Focus to Global South:** The discourse on neighborhoods has expanded to include a focus on the Global South, with studies on slums, Muslim neighborhoods, and ghettos. These studies explore the complex social and political structures that contribute to urban inequalities.

5. **Spatial Turn and Globalization:** In recent decades, urban planning discourse has shifted towards understanding the dynamics of space. Scholars have been influenced by works like Lefebvre's "The Production of Space," Castells' Marxist urban analysis, and Harvey's theories that intertwine the history of capital with the history of cities. The spatial turn has been influenced by the increased global flow of capital, goods, and ideas, often referred to as globalization.

6. **Gated Communities and Hyper-Segregation:** The passage mentions the emergence of gated communities as exclusionary spaces, designed to separate social groups based on economic inequality. This phenomenon, along with hyper-segregation, has led to the rise of fortress-like urban environments.

7. **Localities vs. Neighborhoods:** Scholars have conceptualized social dynamics in neighborhoods from the perspective of placemaking, with a focus on how global linkages reshape cultural forms and social relationships. This perspective emphasizes the construction of place through social relations rather than essential identities or traditions.

8. **The Focus of the Book:** The passage highlights that the book's primary focus is on unpacking the social life within neighborhoods. It aims to explore how the social and spatial aspects come together to shape a distinct understanding of sociality within neighborhoods, especially in the context of Indian society. The book does not prioritize the local/global binary but rather examines the social life of neighborhoods itself.

Overall, the passage provides insights into the complex and evolving discourse on neighborhoods, emphasizing their significance in understanding urban life, inequalities, and social dynamics.


This passage delves deeper into the challenges and complexities of studying neighborhoods as units of social reality. It acknowledges the importance of addressing these challenges while recognizing neighborhoods as crucial building blocks for understanding life in cities. The passage also highlights four specific challenges:

1. **The Concept of Neighborhood as a Unit of Study:** The first challenge is to reconsider the concept of the neighborhood as a unit of study. This involves questioning the traditional notions of neighborhoods as fixed, administrative boundaries or containers of social relationships. Instead, the approach aims to understand neighborhoods as spaces from the perspectives and experiences of the people who inhabit them.

2. **Avoiding the Local vs. Global Binary:** The second challenge is to study neighborhoods in the contemporary context without falling into the binary trap of local versus global. It emphasizes the need to examine how neighborhoods are shaped by both local and global influences, without privileging one over the other.

3. **Avoiding Treating Neighborhoods as Passive Spaces:** The third challenge is to avoid treating neighborhoods merely as passive locations, backgrounds, or settings for understanding community dynamics or social complexities. Instead, it encourages researchers to explore the active and dynamic aspects of neighborhoods and their role in shaping social life.

4. **Engaging with Non-Western Urban Landscapes:** The fourth challenge is to engage with the specificities of neighborhoods in non-Western urban landscapes like India. This involves recognizing that neighborhoods in different cultural contexts may have unique characteristics, practices, and dynamics that require distinct approaches for understanding.

The passage then introduces two chapters from the book that illustrate how these challenges are addressed:

- Gauri Bharat's chapter explores Jain neighborhoods in Ahmedabad and emphasizes the role of religious institutions, such as derāsars and upāshrays, in neighborhood formation. It shows how the bonds between sangh members are not solely based on spatial delineation but are influenced by ritual activities and collective practices.

- Anakshi Pal's chapter examines the idea of a neighborhood among Kāshivāsis in Varanasi, focusing on those who come to the city with the hope of attaining salvation. It challenges the conventional notion of a neighborhood as primarily a social unit and explores the unique social character of an āshram inhabited by mumukshus.

These chapters exemplify the book's approach of understanding neighborhoods as socio-spatial entities shaped by various factors, including culture, religion, and everyday practices, while also addressing the challenges inherent in this approach.

In this section of the text, the focus shifts to the idea of neighborhoods as spaces of in-betweenness, especially in the context of refugee settlements and Dalit (Scheduled-Caste) colonies in urban India. The text highlights how these spaces challenge conventional notions of neighborhoods and reveal unique socio-spatial dynamics:

1. **Refugee Resettlement Colonies:** The text discusses how Dalit refugee resettlement colonies in post-Partition Delhi represent an in-between space. These colonies were formed as a result of the partition of India in 1947, leading to a significant influx of refugees into Delhi. While some refugees succeeded in moving up the economic ladder and integrating into Delhi, others, like the residents of Jhilmil (a Dalit colony), faced neglect and discrimination. Akanksha Kumar's research complicates the transformation of refugee identities and personhood within these spaces.

2. **Basti: A Stigmatized Typology:** The text also highlights the stigmatization of lower-caste settlements labeled as "bastis." In the urban discourse of India, bastis are associated with sub-standard, temporary structures and often carry rural connotations. Such neighborhoods were a cause for concern among planners and governments. Awadhendra Sharan's work points out that bastis were seen as spaces where people from different backgrounds were expected to assimilate.

3. **Dalit Neighborhoods as Sites of Resistance:** The text discusses how Dalit bastis in North India have historically been sites of everyday resistance, discrimination, and negotiations. Vijay Kumar's research delves into the history of these bastis, emphasizing the importance of paying attention to everyday forms of resistance and subversive strategies employed by their inhabitants. These neighborhoods have been spaces where transformative energy is unleashed.

4. **Challenging the Local vs. Global Binary:** The text acknowledges the challenge of studying neighborhoods in a contemporary context without falling into the binary trap of local versus global. It advocates for an approach that goes beyond these binaries and recognizes the complex, localized, and globalized dynamics shaping neighborhoods.

5. **Emphasis on Practices and Experiences:** The text emphasizes a focus on practices and experiences within neighborhoods rather than ideologies and economic processes. It aligns with an ethnographic approach that explores the open-endedness of urban life in South Asia without rigid terminology.

Overall, the text encourages a nuanced understanding of neighborhoods as spaces with agency and historical significance, challenging conventional definitions and binaries while recognizing the complex interplay of local and global forces.


In this section of the text, the focus is on the contemporary aspects of neighborhoods, especially in the context of various challenges and dynamics that shape them:

1. **Identity Politics in Golakgunj, Assam:** The text discusses how identity politics and anxieties about identity play a significant role in shaping neighborhoods, particularly in Golakgunj, Assam, which borders Bangladesh. The political debates around "illegal immigration," citizenship documentation (NRC), and the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 (CAB) have created a context where spatial intimacies and neighborliness are intertwined with questions of belonging and citizenship. This chapter explores the micro-social elements of everyday life in the neighborhood, such as conversations among women, stereotypes, secret-keeping, and trust-building, all within the backdrop of identity politics.

2. **Conflict of Value Regimes in Delhi's Urban Villages:** Rashi Bhargava and Richa Chilana's research delves into the conflict of value regimes in Delhi's urban villages, specifically concerning single female migrant tenants. The study examines how marital status and gender play a crucial role in the social organization of urban spaces. It highlights the gendered processes of accessing and establishing a home and how societal biases affect the experiences of single men and women in the neighborhood.

3. **The Figure of "Parosan" in Neighborhoods:** Sadan Jha's research focuses on the figures of "paros" (neighbors), particularly "parosan" (female neighbors), as crucial to understanding neighborhoods. This perspective allows for an exploration of spatial affectivity and how gender politics shape urban experiences in South Asian contexts.

4. **The Role of Homes in Neighborhoods:** Sonal Mithal, Yugank Goyal, and Sheema Fatima's chapters emphasize the role of homes in shaping neighborhoods. They explore architectural history, the economics of buying versus renting homes, and the influence of modular modernity on aspirations for homes. These studies highlight how housing and neighborhoods are intricately linked and influenced by socio-economic factors and modernity.

These chapters collectively address the challenges of studying neighborhoods in non-Western urban landscapes like India while emphasizing the socio-spatial dynamics, identity politics, and everyday experiences that shape contemporary neighborhoods.

In this section of the text, the discussion revolves around the social dynamics of neighborhoods in the Global South, with a particular focus on India. It challenges the predominant economic frames and categories used to understand urbanization and emphasizes the importance of shifting attention to social processes, practices, and experiences within neighborhoods. Here are the key points made in this section:

1. **Neighborhoods as Social Institutions:** The text references Rajnarayan Chandavarkar's perspective on neighborhoods as "social institutions." This means that neighborhoods are not just physical spaces but are also shaped by social relationships, values, and practices. For example, in Mumbai's mill districts, social bonds and identities are often tied to the neighborhood, where residents working in the same mills and residing in the same vicinity form a sense of community.

2. **Complexity of Social Relations:** The text highlights that neighborhood dynamics are not necessarily characterized by harmony or homogeneity. Instead, they often involve competition, conflicts, and antagonism among residents. Neighborhoods are not solely based on proximate living; they are shaped by various social factors and power relations.

3. **Political Nature of Neighborhood Formation:** The process of forming neighborhoods, such as mill districts in Mumbai, is described as a political process. This implies that neighborhood boundaries and identities are not natural but are influenced by political and social factors. Different locations of power and influence exist within neighborhoods, and these dynamics are complex.

4. **Challenges in Studying Neighborhoods:** The text points out the challenges in studying neighborhoods, particularly in the context of the Global South. It notes that neighborhoods are often studied from a perspective of deprivation or segregation and are defined primarily as administrative units. However, this oversimplified approach ignores the complexities of social life and the ambiguous value systems and cultural dynamics within neighborhoods.

Overall, the text advocates for a deeper exploration of the social relationships and practices within neighborhoods, acknowledging their role as social institutions and the need to move beyond economic frames in understanding urbanization in the Global South.

In this section of the text, the discussion centers on two main objectives that run through the chapters in the book:

1. **Excavating Social Practices and Flows:** The first objective is to uncover and understand the social practices and flows within neighborhoods through ethnographic fieldwork. The chapters in the book aim to delve into the complexities of everyday life, community dynamics, and social relationships that shape neighborhoods in various contexts in northern India.

2. **Production of Knowledge about Neighborhoods:** The second objective is to examine how knowledge about neighborhoods is produced and how it shapes different discourses and disciplinary frames related to urban studies. The book explores the ways in which different academic disciplines contribute to our understanding of neighborhoods and how these contributions are shaped by regional and cultural contexts.

The text also highlights the challenges and complexities of studying neighborhoods, particularly in the Indian context, where the term "neighborhood" carries multiple meanings and implications. It emphasizes the need to move beyond simplistic definitions and recognize that neighborhoods are not static or uniform entities but are shaped by historical, social, and cultural factors.

Furthermore, the text discusses the limitations of existing scholarship on neighborhoods, which often overlook the nuances of social life within neighborhoods and tend to treat them as taken-for-granted or organic spatial units. It calls for a more nuanced and critical examination of neighborhoods as social institutions, emphasizing the need to privilege the neighborhood as a concept in the discourse on urban society in India.

The text also briefly touches upon the challenges posed by the terminology used to describe neighborhoods in India, with various regional terms such as "mohallā," "pol," "wādā," "basti," "paros," "pārā," and "jawaar" carrying specific regional and cultural connotations.

Overall, the text encourages researchers to explore the possibilities and challenges presented by the concept of "neighborhood" and to engage in ethnographic research that uncovers the rich and dynamic social life within neighborhoods in India.

This section of the text explores the historical aspects of vernacular terms like "mohallā," "pārā," "wādā," etc., and their implications for understanding neighborhoods in India. It raises important questions about whether these vernacular terms should be understood as imprecise or indicative of a lack of town planning in precolonial India. Additionally, it questions whether the imposition of Western concepts like "neighborhood" is appropriate when studying non-Western societies like India.

Here are some key points from this section:

1. **Mohallā as a Complex Concept:** The term "mohallā" is seen as having a much broader and deeper connotation than the Western concept of "neighborhood." It encompasses not only spatial aspects but also familial and sociocultural relationships among its residents. In this sense, it is viewed as an extended family unit where intense personal interactions and social bonds exist.

2. **Implications of Western Concepts:** There is opposition to imposing Western terms and concepts on Indian landscapes. Critics argue that terms like "neighborhood" may not capture the intricate social dynamics and relationships found in mohallās.

3. **Mythic Harmony vs. Contemporary Realities:** While the idea of mohallās as harmonious and safe places may seem romanticized from a contemporary perspective with a focus on contestation and conflict, the memory of such harmony continues to circulate and serves as a template in the aftermath of communal violence.

4. **Complexities of Insider vs. Outsider:** The distinction between insiders (locals) and outsiders in the context of mohallās can be blurred during communal conflicts, challenging the binary notion of neighborliness.

5. **Historical Evidence:** Historical sources indicate that terms like mohallā, sannivesa, vaata, chhatta, katra, and tripolia have been used to denote different types of localities, neighborhoods, or quarters in ancient and medieval India. These localities often had specific names based on the occupation of residents, characteristics of the place, or the person who built it.

Overall, this section underscores the need to appreciate the complexity and historical depth of vernacular terms used to describe urban socio-spatial units in India. It also raises questions about the appropriateness of applying Western concepts to understand these unique and multifaceted social units.

This section of the text delves further into the historical context of neighborhoods in India, focusing on the example of Shahjahanabad and other cities to explore the dynamics of residential and commercial spaces, as well as issues of segregation and town planning. Some key points in this section include:

1. **Absence of Segregation:** In the case of Shahjahanabad, it is mentioned that there was no strict segregation of houses between the rich and the poor or between residential and commercial areas. This challenges the notion that segregation between social classes or between residential and commercial zones developed primarily under British colonial rule.

2. **Historical References:** Historical references from travelers and historians provide insights into the number and naming of mohallās (neighborhoods) in 18th and early 19th-century Delhi, reflecting the historical context and characteristics of these neighborhoods.

3. **Relevance of Historical Context:** The historical exploration is not meant to focus on neighborhoods in precolonial periods but to emphasize the historical shifts and complexities in the concept of neighborhoods in India. The idea is to understand how the meaning of neighborhoods has evolved over time.

4. **Concept of "Fictive Kinship":** Sylvia Vatuk's concept of "fictive kinship" is introduced, which refers to the use of kinship terms among neighbors that do not necessarily indicate a genealogical relationship. This highlights the importance of social relationships and interactions within neighborhoods.

5. **Proximity and Social Control:** Janaki Abraham's work is mentioned, emphasizing the significance of proximity and sensorial interactions in neighborhood life. Neighborhoods are seen as spaces where identities are produced, influenced by relationships, kinship practices, and shared everyday experiences.

Overall, this section contributes to the understanding of neighborhoods in India by highlighting the historical context, social dynamics, and the evolving meanings associated with these vernacular spatial units. It also emphasizes the role of proximity and everyday interactions in shaping neighborhood identities and relationships.

In conclusion, this book on neighborhoods in urban India seeks to enrich our understanding of urban life by focusing on the particularities and roles of neighborhoods in shaping urban experiences. Several key arguments and implications emerge from the discussions presented in the book:

1. **Religiosity and Neighborhoods:** The book highlights the presence of religious institutions and religiosity in the formation and character of neighborhoods. It emphasizes the need to recognize the influence of religiosity as an overt or hidden aspect of everyday life, contributing to the sacred dimensions of neighborhoods.

2. **Caste and Untouchability:** Caste and untouchability have played significant roles in shaping the spatial history of urban landscapes. The book argues for the inclusion of caste dynamics and the experiences of Dalit neighborhoods in the study of neighborhoods, emphasizing the importance of spatial subjectivities.

3. **Oral Archives and Everyday Life:** An anthropology of neighborhood spaces should draw from oral archives of everyday life to understand the micro-politics and contestations that shape community and neighborhood formations.

4. **Gendered Spatial Subjectivities:** The book underscores the importance of gendered bodies and codes within neighborhoods. Examining the gendered dimensions of neighborhoods is essential to understanding spatial subjectivities and affectivity.

5. **Recalibrating Planning Concerns:** While acknowledging the dominance of planning concerns in neighborhood discourse, the book argues for a recalibration of these concerns. It suggests that neighborhoods are formed through responses to dominant planning templates and housing aspirations, highlighting the need to consider grassroots perspectives.

6. **Regional Vividness and Ambiguities:** By exploring neighborhoods as regional, experiential, and culturally diverse entities, the book aims to move beyond the confines of megacity-centric urban discourse. It encourages a more holistic understanding of urban social life.

The book acknowledges the potential for further research and exploration in the realm of neighborhoods, including the study of cultural expressions, literary and popular cultural materials, mediated communications, and sensory experiences within neighborhoods. While recognizing its own limitations, the book sets the stage for future inquiries into the hidden mythologies of urban life.
