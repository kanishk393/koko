The text provides a review of urbanization and urban policy in post-independent India, focusing on the shifts in urban policy from the early 1990s. The author begins by highlighting the historical context, noting the relative silence on urban issues in early development planning, which was dominated by the vision of rural and industrialized nation-building.

Key Points:
1. **Historical Context:** The early years of development planning in India, influenced by visions of village republics and industrialization, had minimal consideration for urban issues. The author attributes this to the nationalist discourse's relationship with the concept of the 'city.'

2. **Contemporary Shift:** In contrast, the contemporary scenario sees a dominant focus on urban issues in governmental action and public discourse. The significance of cities as engines of economic growth has gained prominence, driven by global neoliberalism in the last few decades.

3. **Author's Aim:** The author's primary goal is to review post-independence urban policy in India, specifically tracing the trajectory of urban reform initiatives since the early 1990s. The paper intends to link ongoing neoliberal urban reforms with the current process of urban restructuring in India.

4. **Urbanization Trends:** The text discusses the rapid pace of urbanization in India over the last two centuries. It notes the historical growth of the urban population, with India currently having the second-largest urban population globally. The author emphasizes the need for a sustainable and equitable paradigm for urban development.

5. **Challenges and Issues:** The challenges of urban development become apparent, with issues such as slum eviction, closure of industries, and the changing employment landscape. The cities are described as increasingly becoming exclusionary, favoring the elite and white-collar workforce.

6. **Scope of Analysis:** The author acknowledges that urban development policies are state subjects under the Constitution, making a comprehensive analysis challenging without considering policies at the state level. The focus remains on analyzing national-level urban policies and programs to understand the overall direction of urban policy in India.

7. The author, Lalit Batra, explores the evolution of urbanization and urban policy in post-independent India. The analysis spans different phases, examining key policy shifts and their impact on Indian cities.

**Overview of Urbanization in India:**
Urbanization in India has undergone significant growth over the past two centuries. In 1800, only 2 percent of the population lived in urban areas, but by 2003, the United Nations estimated that more people lived in urban than rural areas. India, with the second-largest urban population globally, has experienced rapid urban growth, with the urban population increasing tenfold between 1901 and 2001.

**Urban Policy in Post-Independent India:**

1. **The First Phase (1951–1966):** This phase was marked by a focus on housing and rehabilitation, driven by the influx of refugees post-Partition and wartime employment opportunities. The First Five Year Plan emphasized spatial and occupational rehabilitation, leading to the creation of rehabilitation colonies and sub-towns. The plan also highlighted the need for slum clearance and industrial and employer housing.

2. **The Second Phase (1969–1984):** The Fourth Plan emphasized balanced urban growth, dispersing populations to smaller urban centers. The creation of small towns and regional planning became crucial. The period saw the introduction of the Slums Areas (Improvement and Clearance) Act in 1956 and the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act in 1976. The focus shifted to environmental improvement of slums rather than mass relocation.

3. **The Third Phase (1980–1985):** The Sixth Plan concentrated on developing small and medium towns, introducing the Integrated Development of Small and Medium Towns (IDSMT) scheme. This phase abandoned the strategy of massive slum relocation, emphasizing increased investment in environmental improvements for slums.

Despite these efforts, challenges persisted, such as the failure to achieve balanced regional development and the limited impact of legislation like the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act in redistributing land equitably.

The narrative provides a comprehensive review of urban policy in India, emphasizing the changing approaches to housing, slums, and regional development in different plan periods.

**The Third Phase: 1986–**

In the mid-1980s, India initiated economic liberalization, marking a shift in urban policy towards private sector involvement. The 7th Plan emphasized radical changes in housing policies, reducing the government's role and promoting private sector participation. The National Housing Bank and Urban Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation were proposed to boost housing finance and enhance urban infrastructure.

**National Housing Policy (1988)**

The first National Housing Policy aimed at addressing houselessness, improving living conditions, and providing basic services. The government's role was defined as a provider for the poor and vulnerable, with an emphasis on facilitating other income groups and the private sector. The Integrated Development of Small and Medium Towns (IDSMT) remained a crucial urban scheme during this period.

**Urban Poverty Alleviation (1985–1990)**

To address urban poverty, the 7th Plan introduced the Urban Basic Services (UBS) and later merged it into the Urban Basic Services for Poor (UBSP). Additionally, the Nehru Rozgar Yojana (NRY) in 1989 aimed at generating employment opportunities for the urban poor.

**National Commission on Urbanisation (NCU) - 1989**

Under Charles Correa's chairmanship, the NCU emphasized the link between urbanization and economic development. It identified Generator of Economic Momentum (GEM) cities, National Priority Centres (NPCs), State Priority Centres (SPCs), and Spatial Priority Urban Regions (SPURs) for planned urban growth.

**Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) - 1991**

In response to the balance of payment crisis, the SAP introduced economic liberalization. The 8th Plan (1992–97) aligned with SAP principles, focusing on linking urban growth with economic development.

**Key Policies and Schemes of the 8th Plan**

- Spatial and economic dimension planning
- Convergence of urban development programs
- Legal, organizational, and financial measures for urban land and housing
- Promotion of public-private partnerships
- Decentralization through the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act (CAA)

**India Infrastructure Report (1996)**

The report advocated privatization and commercialization of infrastructure, emphasizing a demand-oriented approach. It projected significant infrastructure investment requirements and recommended reforms in governance, legislation, and administration.

This summary provides an overview of the urbanization and urban policy in India from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s, highlighting key phases, policies, and initiatives.

**Summary:**

*Introduction:*
The 9th Plan (1997–2002) acknowledged the skewed urbanization in India and the failure of the IDSMT in reducing regional disparities. It emphasized state governments' role in resource mobilization and private sector involvement in overcoming infrastructural deficiencies.

*Sectoral Objectives:*
The 9th Plan aimed at developing urban areas economically, providing housing for low-income groups, upgrading urban infrastructure, alleviating urban poverty, ensuring accessibility to basic services for the poor, improving the urban environment, and promoting private sector and NGO participation.

The JNNURM marked a significant shift towards market-driven urban development, outlining key reforms and priorities for state governments and ULBs.

**Title: Mandatory Reforms for Urban Development**

**Introduction:**
The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) outlines mandatory reforms at both the state and municipal levels to promote effective urban development. These reforms aim to enhance governance, streamline financial practices, and improve the overall living conditions in cities.

### **State Level Mandatory Reforms:**
1. **Decentralization Initiatives:** Implementing the Constitution (Seventy-Fourth) Amendment Act, 1992.
2. **Repeal of Urban Land Act:** Abolishing the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976.
3. **Rent Control Laws:** Reforming rent control laws for better urban management.
4. **Stamp Duty Rationalization:** Gradual reduction to a maximum of 5 percent within seven years.
5. **Public Disclosure Law:** Enacting laws for transparent public disclosure.
6. **Community Participation Law:** Institutionalizing citizens' involvement in local decision-making.
7. **City Planning Function:** Involving elected municipalities in city planning.

### **Municipal Level Mandatory Reforms:**
1. **Accounting Reforms:** Adopting a modern, accrual-based, double-entry accounting system.
2. **E-Governance Implementation:** Utilizing IT applications, GIS, and MIS for urban services.
3. **Property Tax Reform:** Enhancing property tax collection efficiency to 85 percent.
4. **User Charges:** Implementing user charges to recover operation and maintenance costs within seven years.
5. **Budget Earmarking:** Allocating budgets for basic services to the urban poor.
6. **Provision of Basic Services:** Ensuring security of tenure and affordability for the urban poor.

### **Optional Reforms:**
Implementing any two of the following each year:
1. Streamlining approval processes for construction.
2. Simplifying frameworks for converting agricultural land.
3. Introducing property title certification.
4. Earmarking land in housing projects for economically weaker sections.
5. Computerized registration of land and property.
6. Administrative and structural reforms.
7. Encouraging public-private partnerships.

### **Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns (UIDSSMT):**
A scheme similar to JNNURM for towns with a population less than one million, encompassing various merged programs.

### **Concerns and Critique:**
The urban reform agenda, particularly the repeal of the Urban Land Act, is criticized for favoring elite interests, potentially concentrating urban land in the hands of domestic and foreign real estate firms. The liberalization of land is questioned for its impact on the urban poor, leading to increased evictions and insecure employment.

### **Policy Implications:**
The analysis raises concerns about the alignment of the urban reform agenda with neoliberal ideology and its potential consequences, emphasizing the need for a more inclusive and pro-poor approach in urban development policies.

### **Conclusion:**
While the JNNURM and related initiatives aim for high growth, there are concerns about the impact on land distribution and housing for the poor. The focus on liberalization and financial self-reliance for urban local bodies may limit their ability to address the needs of the marginalized sections of society. The ultimate outcome of these reforms remains uncertain, with potential implications for both growth and social equity.
