Chapter 1 of the book explores the fundamental question: "What is Politics?" It begins by acknowledging that politics is a complex and contested concept, and it aims to provide a nuanced understanding of this term. Here is a detailed summary of the key points from Chapter 1:

**Introduction**
The chapter sets the stage for discussing the definition of politics and highlights the need to clarify the meaning of terms like "politics" and "the political." It emphasizes that the chapter will introduce concepts that will be explored further in subsequent chapters.

**Characteristics of Politics**
The chapter emphasizes that politics can be reasonably well described by a set of characteristics. These characteristics are not always required, can be combined in different ways, and are not always sufficient to capture the full range of associations and connotations of the term "politics."

**Contested Concept**
The chapter highlights that the concept of politics is "contested," meaning that there is no single, universally satisfying definition of politics. The contested nature of politics is also present in other related concepts used in its definition.

**Definitions of Politics**
The chapter discusses various perspectives on defining politics, with a focus on two main approaches: the aspect perspective and the domain perspective.

1. **Aspect Perspective on Politics**
   - Politics is viewed as an aspect of human relations and interactions in various domains of life, not limited to the state.
   - Politics can be found in domains such as education, healthcare, business, personal relations, and more.
   - Robert Dahl's definition characterizes politics as any persistent pattern of human relationships that involves power, rule, or authority.

2. **Central Aspects of Politics**
   - Power is a common central aspect in many definitions of politics.
   - Some authors emphasize conflict as the core characteristic of politics.
   - Others see politics as a blend of conflict and cooperation.
   - Distribution of resources is highlighted as a key element in defining politics.
   - Collective decision-making is also identified as a fundamental aspect of politics.

**Common Ground**
Despite differences in emphasis among these various definitions, they share common ground in observing political processes and phenomena in situations where people interact. These definitions converge on identifying concrete phenomena, events, and processes as political.

In summary, Chapter 1 lays the groundwork for understanding the concept of politics by introducing various perspectives and definitions. It emphasizes that politics is a multifaceted and contested concept, and its defining characteristics may vary among scholars. This chapter sets the stage for deeper exploration of these characteristics in subsequent chapters.


Chapter 1 of the book explores two contrasting perspectives on the nature of politics: the "aspect perspective" and the "domain perspective."

**1. Aspect Perspective on Politics:**
- Politics is viewed as a pervasive aspect of human relations and interactions in various domains of life, not limited to the state.
- It suggests that politics exists in various contexts, including education, healthcare, business, personal relationships, and more.
- Robert Dahl defines politics within this perspective as "any persistent pattern of human relationships that involves, to a significant extent, power, rule, or authority."
- Other scholars emphasize different central aspects of politics, including conflict, cooperation, distribution of resources, and collective decision-making.
- The aspect perspective allows for the study of political phenomena in a wide range of contexts and leads to innovative insights.

**2. Domain Perspective on Politics:**
- In contrast to the aspect perspective, the domain perspective holds that politics is exclusively related to a specific context of organizations, institutions, and actors, mainly centered around the state.
- Politics, according to this view, is not omnipresent; it is confined to its own political domain, often referred to as "the state," "government," "public administration," or "the public sphere."
- This perspective has a long history, dating back to philosophers like Aristotle, and it remains influential today.
- Definitions such as "government policy, along with its construction and its effects" and "the expression of social conflicts at the level of the state" are consistent with the domain perspective.
- The domain perspective distinguishes between matters that are political (belonging to the political domain) and those that are not.

**Comparison of the Two Perspectives:**
- The aspect perspective allows for the study of a broad range of political processes across various contexts, even those not typically considered political.
- However, it may not provide clear guidance on which political processes are most important or relevant.
- The domain perspective, on the other hand, focuses on politics within the state and government and helps distinguish between public and private spheres.
- It provides a more concentrated approach to the study of political phenomena.
- Both perspectives have their advantages and limitations. The choice between them may depend on the specific research questions and goals, as well as the context being studied.
- The domain perspective may face challenges in defining and demarcating the state and government, especially in contexts where the boundaries between state and society blur.
- It may also struggle to adapt to varying government concerns in different states or historical periods.
- Additionally, it may not account for international relations or situations where there is no discernible state.

In summary, Chapter 1 provides an in-depth exploration of the aspect and domain perspectives on politics, highlighting their implications and challenges. These perspectives offer different lenses through which to understand the nature of politics and guide the study of political phenomena.


Chapter 1 of the book introduces several additional perspectives on politics beyond the aspect and domain perspectives. These perspectives offer alternative ways of understanding and defining politics:

**1. Politics as Designing the Future of Society:**
- Gijs Kuypers, a Dutch political scientist, defines politics as "designing the future of an entire society and influencing this design."
- This definition focuses on the macro-level and suggests that politics involves shaping the future of society.
- It does not limit politics to the state and government but leaves open the possibility that various actors, including churches, firms, social movements, and individuals, can be involved in designing the future of society.
- The emphasis is on substantive goals, visions, ambitions, and policy in the process of designing the future.

**2. David Easton's Abstract Definition:**
- David Easton, an influential American political scientist, defines politics as "those interactions through which values are allocated authoritatively for a society."
- This definition, like Kuypers', focuses on the level of society rather than the state or government.
- It includes the allocation of values, both material and immaterial, as well as the availability of collective goods.
- The term "authoritative" implies that these allocations are binding for society.
- This definition raises questions about the distinction between political and economic processes and how values are allocated in different contexts.

**3. Politics as a Style of Behavior and Competence:**
- Some interpretations of politics emphasize it as a style of behavior, competence, or craft.
- In this view, politics is seen as the competence to realize specific goals effectively given the circumstances.
- It is not limited to state or government actors but can be employed by individuals or groups.
- This perspective underscores the importance of competence in achieving goals and involves elements such as anticipation, calculation, persuasion, strategy, and tactics.
- It highlights that politics can be used for various purposes, including substantive policy goals or the pursuit and preservation of power.

**Negative Associations with Politics:**
- The chapter also acknowledges that politics can have negative associations, particularly when it involves duplicity or the pursuit of power for its own sake.
- The negative connotations of politics can lead to unfavorable evaluations and perceptions.

In summary, Chapter 1 introduces these alternative perspectives on politics, highlighting that politics can be understood as the process of designing the future of society, the authoritative allocation of values, and a style of behavior and competence. These perspectives provide a more comprehensive understanding of what politics encompasses, beyond its location and stakes, and acknowledge the potential negative associations with political behavior.


Chapter 1 concludes by summarizing some common features that can be identified across the various definitions and perspectives on politics discussed in the chapter. These common features help provide a better understanding of the nature of politics:

1. **Politics is a Social Phenomenon:** Politics exists in the relations and interactions between people, and it pertains to groups, collectives, or societies. Defining the boundaries of these groups and societies is essential for meaningful discussions about politics.

2. **Involvement of Political Systems:** Politics involves matters that must be settled for an entire group, collective, or society. This includes managing conflicts, making collectively binding decisions, and more. Many societies and organizations have specialized institutions responsible for these functions, collectively constituting the political domain.

3. **Involvement of Power and Power Relations:** Politics inherently involves power and power relations. The acquisition, retention, and loss of power are critical aspects of political interactions. Understanding how power operates in political processes is vital.

4. **Stakes in Political Processes:** Political processes always involve something at stake. This can range from the design of the political system itself and its relations with its environment to the realization of specific solutions for problems. Stakes may also include the competition for power and other resources necessary to achieve political goals.

These common features provide a foundation for understanding politics, irrespective of the specific definition or perspective one adopts. While the chapter acknowledges the diversity of definitions and perspectives on politics, it also highlights the importance of these shared elements in shaping our understanding of political phenomena.


The section discusses the nature of contested concepts and why it is challenging to arrive at universally accepted definitions, not only for the concept of politics but also for other terms central to the study of politics. Here are the key points regarding contested concepts:

1. **Complexity:** Contested concepts are complex and derive their meaning from multiple components, none of which is sufficient to fully define the concept. This complexity makes it difficult to provide exhaustive and unambiguous definitions.

2. **Complex Components:** Some components within contested concepts can themselves be complex, further complicating attempts at clear definitions.

3. **Descriptive and Evaluative Components:** Contested concepts typically contain both descriptive (empirical) and evaluative (normative) components. Descriptive components refer to observable phenomena, while evaluative components involve value judgments. These evaluative aspects are often implicit but are essential for understanding the concept's purpose and meaning.

4. **Recursive Definitions:** Formulating definitions often requires using words that themselves need defining, leading to a potentially endless cycle of defining terms. Primitive terms, which derive their meaning from everyday language, are used in definitions but may carry implicit normative meanings.

5. **Shared Understanding and Differences:** Contested concepts have varying meanings for different individuals. However, there is usually some degree of shared understanding that enables communication. Differences in meaning can arise from associations, importance placed on those associations, and evaluative connotations.

6. **Debate and Communication:** Debate about the meaning of contested terms is crucial to avoid confusion and misunderstandings. While full agreement may not be achievable, the goal is to foster productive dialogue and prevent miscommunication.

In essence, contested concepts in political science, such as politics itself, are characterized by their multifaceted and sometimes ambiguous nature, which makes it challenging to arrive at universally accepted definitions. However, acknowledging and engaging in debates about these concepts are essential for clear communication and understanding within the field.


This section discusses the role of words and language in politics, highlighting that the meanings of important concepts are often contested and shaped by political processes. Here are the key points:

1. **Language and Meaning:** Language plays a crucial role in shaping how we perceive and understand political phenomena. The words and phrases used to describe issues, concerns, and norms are often complex and multifaceted, with both descriptive and normative meanings.

2. **Effect on Political Discourse:** The choice of words and interpretations can have significant implications for political discourse. Different interpretations of key terms can lead to varying policy proposals, alliances, and outcomes in political decision-making.

3. **Political Implications:** Designating a problem or concern as "political" implies that it should be addressed within the political domain, potentially involving public debate, policy-makers, and parliamentary decisions. On the other hand, terms like "technical," "medical," or "scientific" may lead to different norms and procedures.

4. **Struggle Over Language:** Competing interests often engage in a struggle over the language used to frame issues. Different groups may seek to establish their choice of words and interpretations to advance their interests and perspectives.

5. **Language as a Tool of Political Conflict:** The struggle over words and language is a manifestation of political conflict and competition. It represents one way in which political actors seek to influence the framing and understanding of issues.

Regarding the perspective adopted in the book, it follows the aspect perspective on politics. This perspective views politics as existing in various human relations and interactions, regardless of whether they are commonly labeled as "political" or not. The book emphasizes that politics involves conflicts and cooperation and explores these aspects in depth. Specific chapters will delve into key questions related to conflict, cooperation, political actors, power, and the broader contexts in which politics operates.

In summary, the book's perspective recognizes the multifaceted nature of politics and aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of political phenomena, with an emphasis on conflict and cooperation as central elements.
